		Audio Response System for Unity
	
	This is an early version of this plugin and has several bugs and missing features.
	There is currently no documentation or tutorial on how to use it, but I hope that 
	the demo scenes are self-explanatory enough to give you a good idea of how to use it.
	
	If you run into any bugs or have any specific features you would like to see, please
	do send me an ask on my tumblr: weaverdev.tumblr.com.
	
		List of known bugs:
	-Changing the frequency resolution to a value above 1024 will cause the equalizer window
	to break.
